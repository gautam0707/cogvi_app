            <h3>What is Intelligence</h3>
            'Intelligence' is an scientific idea and we don't have clear definition to it.<br>
            Human intelligence is one kind of intelligence among uncountably many possible intelligence models.<br>
            Roughly speaking intelligence is the ability to acquire knowledge and applying that knowledge in diverse
            applications.
            creativity and innovative thinking are some great additions to have along with intelligence.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What is Artificial General Intelligence(AGI)</h3>
            Artificial General Intelligence is the intelligence exhibited by an Artificial Intelligent Agent(or simply
            AI Agent) in all situations it might encounter like humans but it might not be similar to human intelligence
            because as long as an AI Agent performs tasks reasonably we don't care if it thinks like humans or not .<br>
            An AI Agent can use its sensors to perceive its environment and it can use its motor controls to perform
            some actions using its cognitive abilities(using its intelligence).<br>
            AGI system as a whole has lot of problems, for example, agent may not be able to perceive all of its
            surroundings at once. Due to its limited capabilities
            it may not be rational 100% and so on.

            It is widely accepted that achieving human level intelligence is enough to call it "AGI agent". Surpassing
            human level intelligence is called "Super Intelligence".
            Some believe Super intelligence can be achieved. People came up with AGI to distinguish from current AI
            research which is mainly focuses on domain specific problem instead of intelligence as a whole, so from here
            on we call AGI simply AI.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How to Engineer AI</h3>
            Although AI is defined to be exhibiting human like intelligence in machines, we don't say it should be same
            as human intelligence. we take the reference of human intelligence because it the best known intelligence
            model to us and comparing AI with human intelligence is simple and reasonable.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Fundamental Processes of AI
                    </h4>

                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reasoning</li>
                    <li>Learning</li>
                    <li>Memory</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    These three processes are at the core of an AI system and have bidirectional relationship with each
                    other.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unified development of these three aspects is crucial in AGI system development. In other schools of
                    AI, where we concentrate on any one of these aspects such as learning in machine learning/ Narrow
                    AI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    whenever we discuss a solution to this one of this fundamental process, one or two of the other
                    fundamental process will be involved in the design.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            Before going through more details of AGI implementation, lets see some important concepts/ideas that are
            needed in AGI development
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Computational Cognitive Psychology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>


                    Psychology is the study of human behavior. Cognitive psychology is a sub field of Psychology where
                    we study the cognitive abilities/functions of mind.
                    Computational modelling of cognitive psychology is required to implement AGI system and to test such
                    AGI system's cognitive abilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One possible test for AGI systems is the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_Progressive_Matrices" target="_blank">"Raven's
                    Progressive matrices"</a> test. This test is based on solving visual analogical problems and is
                    considered one of most reliable tests of intelligence.
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing Test</a> is also a
                    popular test for Artificial Intelligence. The field of studying and assessing the capabilities of AI
                    systems is known as "Computational psychometrics".

                </li>
                <li>If we give the same problem to humans, different persons come up with different strategies to solve
                    them.Listing and modelling those different strategies is important.
                </li>
                <li>Simply, Intelligence can't be defined accurately and there are many kinds of intelligences.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Knowledge is central to any intelligent agent, effective representation and reasoning from knowledge
                    is essential for decision making.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Representing knowledge requires a good representation system that consists of language and content,
                    language is used to represent knowledge and content is the knowledge itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some ways of representing knowledge are
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Semantic Networks
                        </li>
                        Problem with semantic network is the choice of level of abstraction to choose to represent
                        knowledge.
                        <li>
                            Production Rules
                        </li>
                        <li>Frames</li>
                        Frames are basis for commonsense reasoning. Frames exhibit following properties.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Represent Stereotypes
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Provide default values
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Exhibit Inheritance, can be used as object oriented instances
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Many symbolic based models are developed to solve this problem of knowledge representation and
                    reasoning. Markov Logic networks and probabilistic soft logic were also tried. Recently deep
                    learning concepts are being used to attack this problem.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Problem solving Methods</h3>
            combining knowledge representation with problem solving methods enables ai agent to perform better in an
            environment.
            Some problem solving methods are
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Generate and Test
                </li>
                <li>
                    Means-Ends analysis - A heuristic method
                </li>
                <li>
                    Problem Reduction
                </li>
                These methods are called weak methods because they don't use much knowledge.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cognitive Architectures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cognitive architecture consists of everything that is related to AI agent.</li>
                <li>Different levels of abstraction is needed to understand and implement AI agents. At lowest level it
                    has hardware or software program and at the highest level it has tasks applications.
                </li>
                <li>Fundamental assumptions of Cognitive architectures</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Goal Oriented</li>
                    <li>Live in complex environment</li>
                    <li>Uses significant knowledge</li>
                    <li>Uses different levels of knowledge abstractions</li>
                    <li>Flexible</li>
                    <li>Learning from experience</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Kinds of memories</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Long term memory</li>
                Long term memory contains knowledge
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Procedural memory
                    </li>
                    procedural memory contains production rules as knowledge. Production rules can also be thought as
                    knowledge representation.
                    <li>
                        Semantic memory
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Episodic memory
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>working memory</li>
                Long term memory interacts with working memory to help it to use knowledge. working memory contents
                always change based on current decisions and current input.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Learning methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    'Chunking' is a way SOAR uses to resolve impasse by selecting impasse breaking production rule.
                </li>


                <li>
                    Learning by recording cases
                </li>
                Solving one problem using solution of another similar problem
                <li>
                    Case based reasoning
                </li>
                Solving one problem by changing the solution of another similar problem
                <li>
                    Incremental Concept Learning
                </li>
                Identifying concepts/ background knowledge from examples(possibly less in number). Abstracting out those concepts/ideas to
                generalize or keeping constraints to specialize. Use Heuristics to generalize or to specialize.
                When we have large number of examples, we do statistical learning, but real life gives one example at a time, so, incremental concept learning is key in human cognition.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Types of concepts
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Axiomatic concepts - more formal and easy to define - example is 'circle'
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Prototype concepts - example is 'chair'
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Exemplar concepts - less formal and difficult to define - example is 'beauty'
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Types of problems to solve</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Classification
                </li>
                Classification is central to cognition. Classification tasks are performed to distinguish between many kinds of objects, scenarios and so on using very complicated abstractions.
                Incremental concept learning is useful in classification.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Logic</h3>
            Logic is a formal method to represent world. Formal Logic in AI agents consists of two parts. Knowledge base represented using formal logic and an Inference Engine to reason from the knowledge base.

        Inference Engine must satisfy the following two properties
        <ul>
            <li>Soundness</li>
            Only valid conclusions must be proven.
            <li>Completeness</li>
            All valid conclusions must be proven.
        </ul>
        Formal logic is 'Deductive' but human intelligence is mostly 'Abductive' and 'Inductive'.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Deductive - General to specific
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inductive - Specific to General
                </li>
                <li>
                    Abductive - Learning General rules out of limited examples?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Planning</h3>
    </li>
        Planning is central to cognition and a powerful tool for action selection in a state. Problem solving methods such as means ends analysis may cause problems and we will use partial ordering planning and hierarchical task network planning.

        <li>
            <h3>Understanding in AI systems</h3>
            We need a way of representing our knowledge about understanding. Thematic role systems is a way similar to Frames in knowledge representation used in this context.
            In thematic role systems more importance is given to action/verb.

    </ul>
